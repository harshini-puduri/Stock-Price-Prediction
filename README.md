# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting stock price movements in response to **index rebalancing events** using deep learning. Leveraging an LSTM-based architecture, the goal is to forecast how specific stocks are likely to behave when they're added to or removed from major market indices like the S&P 500.

What makes this project special is that it’s not just a machine learning model, it’s a **production-ready, end-to-end ML system**, complete with proper data pipelines, modular code structure, and cloud deployment!!


## 🚀 Key Highlights

- **Problem Statement**: Can we forecast stock price impact from index rebalancing using historical patterns?
- **Model**: A 3-layer LSTM neural network with 100 neurons per layer, built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Pipelines**: Modular pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, training, and prediction.
- **Deployment**: Dockerized app, deployable on AWS Beanstalk, EC2 (via ECR), and Azure containers.
- **Performance**: Achieved an MAE of 0.02 and over 90% predictive accuracy on validation data.
